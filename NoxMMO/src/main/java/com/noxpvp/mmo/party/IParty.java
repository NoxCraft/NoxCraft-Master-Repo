 * Partys are a way for encouraging players to work together more often, and provide a means of chat for a group outside of tc and local.
 * when 2 or more players are in a party the exp gains for each player is boosted by .1 or 10%. Each player is entitled to they're own party
 * and cannot create randomly named partys like is other plugins. This way player can invite people to join they're party or ask another player to join theirs.
 * 
 * If a player sets the password on they're party and gives it to anther player, that player can then join the party without the owner having to accept.
 * 
 * PVP can be toggled on / off and will override any towny setting for ally pvp, allowing for fighting, or preventing mis-conduct during a raid.
